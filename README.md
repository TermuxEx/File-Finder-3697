**Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and may result in criminal charges.**

## üåü Features

- **Multi-Format Archive Support**: Handles ZIP, RAR, 7Z, and PDF files
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses wordlist-based password testing
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Shows current password being tested
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays testing progress and statistics
- **Colored Output**: Enhanced visual feedback with color-coded results
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for forensic purposes
- **Automatic Result Saving**: Saves found passwords to `cracked_passwords.txt`
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Rate Monitoring**: Shows password testing rate per second

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- rarfile library
- pyminizip library
- PyPDF2 library (for PDF support)

## üîß Installation

### Method 1: Direct Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/File-Finder-3697.git
cd File-Finder-3697

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install rarfile pyminizip PyPDF2

# Download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/File-Finder-3697/main/file_finder_3697.py
```

### Requirements File (requirements.txt)
```txt
rarfile>=4.0
pyminizip>=0.2.4
PyPDF2>=1.26.0
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python file_finder_3697.py
```

The tool will guide you through the process interactively:
1. Authorization confirmation
2. Target file path entry
3. Wordlist file path entry
4. Password testing process
5. Results display

### Prerequisites

You need:
1. A password-protected archive file (ZIP, RAR, 7Z, or PDF)
2. A wordlist file containing potential passwords (one per line)

## üìñ How It Works

### Password Testing Process:
1. **Authorization Check**: Confirms legitimate usage
2. **File Validation**: Verifies target file exists and is supported
3. **Wordlist Loading**: Reads passwords from provided wordlist
4. **Sequential Testing**: Tests each password in the wordlist
5. **Real-Time Feedback**: Shows current password being tested
6. **Validation**: Attempts to open/archive with each password
7. **Result Recording**: Saves successful passwords to file

### Supported Formats:
- **ZIP Files**: Uses built-in zipfile library
- **RAR Files**: Uses rarfile library
- **PDF Files**: Uses PyPDF2 library
- **7Z Files**: Partial support (requires py7zr for full functionality)

### Security Features:
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents resource exhaustion
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid passwords
- **Interrupt Support**: Clean exit on Ctrl+C
- **Logging**: Detailed activity logging for audit purposes

## üìö Usage Examples

### Example 1: Crack a ZIP file
```bash
python file_finder_3697.py
# Enter: /path/to/protected.zip
# Enter: /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### Example 2: Crack a RAR file
```bash
python file_finder_3697.py
# Enter: /path/to/protected.rar
# Enter: /path/to/password_list.txt
```

### Example 3: Crack a PDF file
```bash
python file_finder_3697.py
# Enter: /path/to/protected.pdf
# Enter: /path/to/dictionary.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Wordlist Format
Create a text file with one password per line:
```
password123
admin123
letmein
qwerty
password
123456
```

### Output Files
- `finder_detailed.log`: Detailed activity log
- `cracked_passwords.txt`: Successful password results

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Module not found" errors**:
   - Install required packages: `pip install rarfile pyminizip PyPDF2`
   
2. **"File not found"**:
   - Check file paths for typos
   - Ensure proper file permissions
   - Use absolute paths if relative paths fail

3. **"Unsupported file format"**:
   - Current version supports: .zip, .rar, .7z, .pdf
   - For 7Z full support, install py7zr: `pip install py7zr`

### Performance Tips:
- Use focused, targeted wordlists for faster results
- Sort wordlists by likelihood (common passwords first)
- Monitor system resources during long operations
- Use SSD storage for better I/O performance
